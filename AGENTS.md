# darius-star — AGENTS.md

## Project: Darius Star: Cyber Coelacanth
Horizontal retro shoot-'em-up space arcade game. 10 biomes × 10 levels. 
Canvas-based browser game. Deployed via Cloudflare Pages from this repo.

**Canonical design reference:** `docs/GAME-DESIGN-DOCUMENT.md` (Jules, June 2026).
The GDD is authoritative for game mechanics, story, characters, biome structure,
and progression. The technical architecture section (§8) is outdated — it describes
the pre-modularization monolith. The module list below is the current ground truth.

## FORBID: Do NOT modify these
- `assets/` — binary game assets (sprites, audio, cinematics)
- `*.py` — build/deploy scripts
- `*.md` — documentation (except this file with approval)

## Architecture (fully modular)
`index.html` is a **378-line HTML/CSS shell** with 36 active external `<script>` tags.
All game logic lives in `js/`. Load order is critical — modules are loaded
in dependency order, with `game_loop.js` and story modules last.

## Key Architecture Notes
- **No IIFE wrappers** — modules use top-level scope. Classes defined in one module
  are visible to all subsequent modules via global scope.
- **Shared utility functions** — `resizeCanvas`, `setNarrativeFlag`, `getNarrativeFlag`,
  `determineEnding`, `createExplosion`, `spawnHitFlash`, `checkCollision`,
  `triggerScrapNarrativeBeat`, `startNGPlus`, `resetGame`, and
  `handleDeathOrVictoryRestart` are defined in `js/utils.js` and loaded first.
- **LevelManager** — global singleton loaded at #31. game_loop.js calls
  `LevelManager.setBiomeAndLevel()`, `LevelManager.update(dt)`, and reads
  `LevelManager.currentLevelConfig.bossTrigger`. Enemy spawning is fully
  delegated to LevelManager.
- **Wave designer reference:** `docs/enemy-wave-designer.md` (Jules) — enemy
  stats, wave composition, formation specs, difficulty scaling formulas.
- **Syntax verification** — use `tests/check_syntax.js` or `tools/run_syntax_sweep.js` for all files.

## Rules
- Keep exact same functionality — no behavior changes
- Add `<script src="js/xxx.js"></script>` tags in index.html for new modules
- Remove extracted code from index.html
- `git push` can take 3-10 minutes (repo is ~11GB). Run in background.
- Use `spritesReady` Set pattern for sprite loading
